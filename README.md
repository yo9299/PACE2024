# One-Sided Crossing Minimization Solver (OCM)

This is a solver for the One-Sided Crossing Minimization Problem (OCM), a problem in graph theory that involves arranging the nodes of a bipartite graph on two layers (typically horizontal), with one of the layers fixed. The objective is to minimize the number of edge crossings between the layers.
